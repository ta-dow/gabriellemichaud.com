                <br>

                    On July 18, I received a text from a friend in the middle of the night inviting me on a trip across Canada. Within 36 hours we were on the road - or rather, we were standing on the side of the road by the highway ramp with our thumbs outstretched. In total, 22 incredible strangers welcomed us into their cars, making our week-long 5,000 kilometre journey from Montréal to Vancouver possible.

                    Although not as common as in the 60s, hitchhiking still allows for a free, exciting and meaningful mode of transportation. There’s no way of knowing what kind of person will pull over for you next – it could be a grandfather eager to share a bucketful of handpicked blackberries, a guidance counsellor covered in tattoos and piercings, a teen returning from Bible camp, or anyone in-between. Every driver has their own story and life advice, and hitchhiking across this beautiful country alongside my friend allowed me to recognize the generosity and kindness expressed by so many. If you do decide to give it a go, here are some tips:

                    “When you’re 30,000ft+ in the air, you oftentimes forget that there are lives, stories, and adventures below. You are flying – no, racing – over happiness, too eager to get to your destination that you forget about the journey. I urge you to discover. All you need is curiosity.”
